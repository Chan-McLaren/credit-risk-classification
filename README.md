# credit-risk-classification

Overview:

A machine learning model was developed to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers using a dataset of lending activity from a lending service company. The dataset included financial information such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status (categorized as 0 for healthy loans and 1 for high-risk loans).

Results:

Machine Learning Model:
Balanced Accuracy Score: 95%

Precision Score: 100% for healthy loans (0's), 
                 85% for high-risk loans (1's)
                 
Recall Score: 99% for healthy loans (0's), 
              91% for high-risk loans (1's)

Summary:

The model performs well with a balanced accuracy score of (95%) with generally high precision and recall scores for both classes. The performance depends on the problem we are trying to solve. In this case, it is more important to correctly predict high-risk loans (class 1). This model appears to be a good choice as it demonstrates high recall for identifying high-risk loans (91%).
Based on these findings, this model is recommended for predicting loan creditworthiness for both healthy and high-risk loans.
